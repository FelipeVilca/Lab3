Console application that takes a (path) filename as an argument.
The program will determine if the file you specified
is a .bmp file or a .png file, and specifies the height and width of the image in pixels. The program sees if
the file specified is neither a .bmp nor .png and identifies and prints the resolution of .bmp files.
Once the program, identified a .png, (in addition to printing
resolution) also list all the chunks (type and size) in the order they
appears in the file.
